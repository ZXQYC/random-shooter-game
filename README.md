# A Random Shooter Game

#### Final Project for CS 242 by Hongyi Chen

This is a simple shooter game made in Python 3, made using PyGame.

First, install Python 3 if you haven't already, and clone or download this repo.

Then, install requirements using this command:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Finally, run this command to play the game:

    python game.py
